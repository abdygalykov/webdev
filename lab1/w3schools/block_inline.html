<!--Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

A block-level element always starts on a new line
-->

<p> Hello World</p>
<div> Hello World</div>


<!-- inline elements do not start on a new line-->

<span>Hello World</span>


<!--
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:
-->

<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
  <h2>London</h2>

</div>

<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
